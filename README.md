# How does Economic Development affect alcohol consumption trends across the globe?

##Abstract
This study investigates the relationship between global economic development and alcohol consumption per capita, exploring how macroeconomic and socio-cultural factors influence drinking behavior. Using a panel dataset of 51 countries over the period 2017–2019, the analysis examines the effects of GDP per capita, Human Development Index (HDI), unemployment rates, income inequality (Gini Index), homebrewing legality, and annual mean temperature on alcohol consumption.

The findings indicate a positive relationship between economic growth—measured by GDP per capita and HDI—and alcohol consumption. Wealthier and more developed countries tend to consume more alcohol, reflecting higher disposable incomes and improved living standards. However, colder climates and higher unemployment rates also correlate with increased alcohol consumption, highlighting complex interactions between economic, environmental, and cultural factors. Income inequality, conversely, exhibits a negative association, suggesting reduced consumption in nations with greater income disparity.

This research contributes to understanding the global implications of economic development on public health and social behaviors. It underscores the need for targeted policies, such as taxation and seasonal restrictions, to mitigate the potential adverse effects of economic growth on alcohol-related harm.

##Key Variables
Dependent Variable: Alcohol consumption per capita (liters of pure alcohol, 15+ years of age).
Independent Variables: GDP per capita, HDI, unemployment rates, Gini Index, homebrewing legality (dummy variable), and annual mean temperature.

##Methodology
Two econometric models were employed:
- A univariate regression analyzing GDP per capita and HDI independently.
- Multivariate regressions incorporating additional variables for a holistic assessment.

##Conclusions
Economic growth, as indicated by GDP per capita and HDI, increases alcohol consumption.
Cooler climates and unemployment rates significantly drive higher alcohol use.
Income inequality reduces consumption, highlighting nuanced socio-economic dynamics.
Policies addressing these factors are essential to balance economic progress with public health goals.

##Limitations
The study acknowledges potential biases from data availability, cultural differences, and multicollinearity among independent variables. Expanding the dataset to include more countries and factors, such as alcohol pricing and cultural diversity, could enhance future analyses.
